                    <p><strong>Hello Kimball Residents!</strong> Here are the residential rules for Kimball Hall for the 2014-2015 academic year:</p> 

                    <h3>Quiet Hours</h3>

                    <p><b>Weekdays:</b> Sunday – Thursday &nbsp&nbsp 11 PM – 8 AM</p>

                    <p><b>Weekends:</b> Friday – Saturday &nbsp&nbsp 1 AM – 9 AM</p>

                    <h3>Lounge Reservations</h3>

                    <p>Common spaces in Kimball, including the Lounge and the Side Lounge, may be reserved for certain events. All reservations are subject to approval by a Kimball staff member. Reservations cannot be made more than one weeks in advance, and cannot conflict with quiet hours. When you make a reservation, you must provide the following information: number of participants, whether there will be food or alcohol, whether the event is registered, the name and room number of the resident making the reservation, the organization or group involved, and the event’s start and end times. In addition, when you make a reservation, you enter a contractual agreement to maintain the clean and neat condition of the space.</p>

                    <p>Note that only the side lounge may be used for events involving alcohol; no alcohol is permitted in other public spaces, with or without reservation. Please see our alcohol and party policies below.</p>

                    <p>For non-Kimball residents, rehearsal space may be reserved in two-hour slots Mondays through Thursdays. One two-hour rehearsal time may be reserved per day, on a first come first served basis, between the hours of 4 PM and 10 PM. Each group may reserve one rehearsal window in Kimball per week.</p>

                    <h3>Kitchenette Policies</h3>

                    <p>The Kitchenette will be left unlocked for all Kimball residents (and transfers living outside of Kimball) to use, but please respect these policies for the benefit of all:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Please wash your dishes, wipe surfaces and try to leave the space cleaner than when you entered.</li>
                      <li>Please return all cooking and cleaning materials and supplies where you found them.</li>
                      <li>Please mark your food items and be sure to remove them when they have expired.</li>
                      <li>Please do not use others’ items without permission. Some items may be marked “For everyone!”</li>
                      <li>Please do not leave plates or silverware from the dining hall in the kitchenette.</li>
                      <li>Please show the same courtesy and respect to your fellow residents that you expect and deserve from others.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Laundry Facility</h3>
             
                    <p>The laundry room is free for all Kimball residents and transfers living outside of Kimball. There are six pairs of machines for a community of more than 200, however, so we must be mindful. To this end, please observe the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Please do not leave your laundry in the washers or dryers for more than a few minutes after its last cycle, and set timers to remind you when to collect or transfer your clothes.</li>
                      <li>If you find other peoples’ clothes in all the washers, please DO NOT move them into empty dryers and start them drying. While this may seem like a courtesy, valuable clothes may be damaged if not intended for the driers. Instead, check with a staff member who will help locate the clothes’ owners.</li>
                      <li>When possible, consider doing your laundry at less heavily trafficked times, e.g. try to avoid Sunday evenings.</li>
                    </ul>
             
                    <h3>Bathrooms</h3>
             
                    <p>To keep our bathrooms clean, please observe the following practices:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Please do not leave your items spread across public surfaces, but make use of cubbies.</li>
                      <li>Please do not use others’ bathroom supplies without permission, or move others’ items.</li>
                      <li>Please leave the bathroom clean and neat; remember to flush toilets and clean toothpaste out of sinks, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
             
                    <h3>Computer Cluster & Email List Etiquette</h3>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Food and all drinks except water (in bottles, not glasses or cups that may easily spill) are prohibited from the Computer Cluster. Liquid kills computers!</li>
                      <li>House E-mail Lists are intended for brief messages and publicity of campus events, not lengthy discussions.</li>
                      <li>For more information about the computer cluster, email, network or other technical issues, please contact our RCCs at <a href="mailto:kimball-rcc@rescomp.stanford.edu" target="_top">kimball-rcc@rescomp.stanford.edu</a>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Recording Studio</h3>

                    <p>Anyone wishing to use Kimball’s recording studio must first take a training tutorial, which will be offered several times throughout the year. Reservations must be made through our online booking system, and are approved at the discretion of Kimball staff. Name, equipment used, hours, phone number, room number, purpose, and the names of all group members must be provided when the reservation is made. Residents cannot record during quiet hours, but mixing can be done at any time if headphones are worn. During the reservation, keys can be borrowed from any staff member. Food and drink are not allowed in the Recording Studio.</p>

                    <h3>Meeting Room and other Public Spaces</h3>

                    <p>Please feel free to work on academic or creative projects (ME101, E14, Honors in the Arts, Senior Reflection, etc.) in the Meeting Room, lounges, study nooks and other public spaces, but be sure to clean up and store your materials and projects, leaving these spaces clean.</p>

                    <h3>Party & Alcohol Policy</h3>

                    <p>Parties in the side lounge must be registered with Party Planning and adhere to University rules.</p>

                    <p>Kimball’s Alcohol Policy is as follows:</p>

                    <p>For students drinking alcohol, we strongly encourage the following practices:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Please keep your door open when alcohol is being served in your room, for your safety and the safety of your guests.</li>
                      <li>Please pace your drinks responsibly. We are all adults, and must drink responsibly at all times to prevent injury or destruction of property.</li>
                      <li>Please exercise special caution when “pre-gaming,” or drinking in your dorm before continuing to other parties.</li>
                      <li>Please favor beer and wine over hard alcohol when possible.</li>
                      <li>When drinking hard alcohol, please mix it with soda, juice or other mixers, and limiting straight shots – the great majority of alcohol related ambulance transports at Stanford are associated with shots of hard alcohol.</li>
                      <li>Please provide your guests with EANABs (tasty non-alcoholic alternatives).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>To keep Kimball’s public spaces open and comfortable for all residents, we allow alcohol only in the side lounge, and only by reservation. All other lounges, study nooks, balconies, hallways and other open spaces are 100% alcohol free.</p>

                    <p>To plan your next registered party, please refer to the <a href="http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/alcohol/party/partyguide">Party Guide</a> provided by Residential Education.</p>

                    <p>We--your RFs, RAs, PHE, RCCs and ATAs--are here to help maintain a fun, safe and healthy Kimball community. Let us all work together to build and maintain a culture and community of kindness and respect—for yourselves, for each other, and for the dorm.</p>

                    <p>Thank you all for your courtesy and consideration—it’s a great pleasure to be your residential staff!</p>
